# OBYS ✨

**OBYS** is a detailed and visually striking front-end replica inspired by [Obys.agency](https://obys.agency), created entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases a complete custom design built to learn and mirror professional agency-level layout, animation, and responsiveness. It features advanced scroll-based interactions, layered visuals, smooth transitions, and responsive elements—all implemented manually without frameworks.
